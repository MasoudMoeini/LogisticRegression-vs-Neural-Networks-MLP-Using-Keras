Take a look at the attached CSV file.<br/>

The CSV encodes annotated data where:<br/>
- each row corresponds to an annotated sample (y, x) where x is the feature vector and y the label.<br/>
In each row:<br/>
- the first column is the label value y in {0, 1}.<br/>

- the remaining columns are the coefficients of the feature vectors of dimension 337<br/>

**Questions:**
<br/>
Write in Python

 

A) (Re-)Implement the following functions in separate utility module:

 

  - to produce a balanced data

If possible we prefer that the candidate reworks ready-to-use helper functions in the learning frameworks using standard ML libraries, rather than exotic tailored libraries (just avoid install new libraries on top of your standard set)

 

  - to randomize the data.

 

  - to populate the training and validation data.

 

Please explain why we need to implement each of these functions.

 

BONUS:

 

Assume you need to implement an extension to be incorporated into a larger project where an input feature vector is generated. Your 'training' features and lables are currenty saved in CSV.

 

B) Implement a training pipeline to solve this classification problem using your favorite deep learning framework.

 

 

ASSESSMENT:

 

You will be assessed on 3 criteria:

  - Quality of the implementation

   -Quality of the model is important, but quality of the code is essential.


  - Concise and informative comments:

    Avoid dry explanations.

  - Testing of the code

    Do not skip your work verification step.
<br/>


- Attention to details, tidiness.

     Getting the job done is good but the way the work is executed also counts.
