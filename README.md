## Multilayer Perceptron 
The purpose of this codes is to compare Logistic Regression vs multilayer perceptron (MLP) Using Keras library in order to practice "building prediction model" from imbalanced rough data set with 338 input features.<br/>

- **Conclusion: Logistic Regression is a suitable model for low range of samples data** comparing with Neural Networks, in MLP numerous hyperparameters and coeffients must be adjusted for training network and the number of parameters in our case is too much and this approach is not optimal.
