## Multilayer Perceptron 
The purpose of this coding experience is to compare Logistic Regression vs Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Using Keras library in order to practice "building a prediction model" from imbalanced rough data set with 338 input features.<br/>

- **Conclusion: Logistic Regression is a suitable model for low range of data samples** to compare with Neural Networks. When we are dealing with high dimentional input data, MLP has numerous hyperparameters and coeffients that must be adjusted for training network and the number of parameters in as issue therefore this approach is not an optimal solution.
